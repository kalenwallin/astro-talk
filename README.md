# Notion as a CMS with React-Notion-X

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```


## What's the big idea ðŸ¤ 
[Notion](https://www.notion.com/) is a glorified notes app with a public api and [React-Notion-X](https://github.com/NotionX/react-notion-x) is a javascript library created by [Travis Fischer](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit) to render the api responses in React.

## How does this project work?

This project was forked from [nicknisi/astro-talk](https://github.com/nicknisi/astro-talk) which created the template of using an astro project with view transitions to make a presentation slide deck. This has allowed me to show the full capabilities of React-Notion-X in realtime. And to allow the audience to follow along and pause at any point to take a closer look at the code and response.
