- Use WordPress (and many other sources) as a headless CMS with Astro for content-driven websites
- Connect via WordPress REST API (built-in) or WPGraphQL plugin (recommended)
- Fetch content at build time for static site generation or dynamically at runtime
- Benefits include improved performance, better security, and reduced server costs
- Maintain WordPress admin experience for content editors while delivering a fast frontend
- Leverage Astro's partial hydration to minimize JavaScript sent to browsers
- Easily integrate with Astro's Content Collections API for type-safe content
